Great—since you’ve already **done user creation on AWS, local access, and shell scripting**, here are **real-time, hands-on tasks** that mirror what Linux/System Admins actually do in production. These are **task-based scenarios**, not theory.

---

## 🔹 TASK 1: User Creation & Access Control (Real Production Scenario)

### Scenario

A new developer joins your team and needs limited access to the server.

### Tasks

1. Create a user `devuser`
2. Set password and force password change on first login
3. Add user to a group `developers`
4. Allow SSH access but **no sudo access**
5. Set account to expire after 30 days
6. Verify login and permissions

### Commands You’ll Use

* `useradd`, `passwd`, `chage`
* `groupadd`, `usermod`
* `id`, `su`

✅ **Expected Outcome:**
User can log in via SSH but cannot install packages or access `/root`.

## 🔹 TASK 2: Linux Basic Commands (Daily Admin Work)

### Scenario

You are troubleshooting disk space and file ownership issues.

### Tasks

1. Find top 5 largest files in `/var`
2. Check disk usage in human-readable format
3. Find files owned by `devuser`
4. Change ownership of `/opt/app` to `developers`
5. Check last login of all users

### Commands Used

* `df -h`, `du -sh`
* `find`
* `ls -lh`
* `lastlog`

## 🔹 TASK 3: Vi Editor – Emergency Production Fix

### Scenario

A service is down due to a wrong config entry.

### Tasks

1. Open `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
2. Search for `PasswordAuthentication`
3. Change value from `no` to `yes`
4. Enable line numbers
5. Undo last change
6. Save and exit

### Vi Shortcuts Used

```
/searchword
:set nu
dd / u
:wq
```

## 🔹 TASK 4: awk – Log File Analysis (Real Monitoring Case)

### Scenario

You need to analyze server access logs.

### Tasks

1. Extract IP addresses from `/var/log/secure`
2. Count failed login attempts per IP
3. Print users who failed login more than 3 times

### Example

```bash
awk '{print $11}' /var/log/secure | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

## 🔹 TASK 5: grep – Security Incident Investigation

### Scenario

Multiple failed SSH attempts detected.

### Tasks

1. Find all “Failed password” entries
2. Search failed attempts for a specific IP
3. Display line numbers of matches
4. Exclude successful logins

### Commands

```bash
grep "Failed password" /var/log/secure
grep -n "Failed password" /var/log/secure
grep -v "Accepted" /var/log/secure
```

## 🔹 TASK 6: find – Cleanup & Maintenance Task

### Scenario

Server storage is almost full.

### Tasks

1. Find `.log` files older than 7 days
2. Delete files larger than 100MB
3. Find files not accessed in 30 days
4. Archive them into `/backup`

### Commands

```bash
find /var/log -type f -mtime +7
find / -size +100M
find /home -atime +30
```

## 🔹 TASK 7: WinSCP – File Transfer (Real DevOps Flow)

### Scenario

Developers send build files to the server.

### Tasks

1. Connect EC2 Linux server using key-based auth
2. Upload files to `/opt/app`
3. Set correct permissions
4. Download log files for debugging

### Permissions

```bash
chmod 755 /opt/app
chown devuser:developers /opt/app
```

---

## 🔹 TASK 8: Combined Mini Project (INTERVIEW LEVEL ⭐)

### Scenario

Deploy and manage an application directory.

### Tasks

1. Create user `appuser`
2. Create `/opt/app/logs`
3. Write shell script to:

   * Monitor disk usage
   * Alert if usage > 80%
4. Schedule script using cron
5. Log output to `/var/log/app_monitor.log`
6. Secure directory permissions

---

## 🔹 TASK 9: Shell Script (Production Ready)

### Script Requirement

* Check disk usage
* Email alert (mock)
* Log date, hostname, usage

```bash
#!/bin/bash
THRESHOLD=80
USAGE=$(df -h / | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | sed 's/%//')

if [ $USAGE -gt $THRESHOLD ]; then
  echo "$(date) Disk usage is high: $USAGE%" >> /var/log/disk_alert.log
fi
```

## 🔹 NEXT STEP (Optional)

If you want, I can:

* Convert these into **interview questions + answers**
* Give **AWS Linux admin real-time scenarios**
* Create **practice labs with expected output**
* Prepare **L1/L2 Linux Admin tasks**

Just tell me 👍
